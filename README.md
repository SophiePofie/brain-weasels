**Hi!**

Thank you for listening to my talk and checking out this list of resources.
Here are some things that help me through the dark days, I hope they help you too!

# Breathing techniques

* [box breathing](https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing#tips-for-beginners)
* [box breathing app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps.paced.breathing&hl=de&pli=1) (This one's for android but I'm certain there's great ones for IOS, too.)
* [pursed lips breathing](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/9443-pursed-lip-breathing)

# Mindfulness exercises (the non-mumbo jumbo kind)

* [5-4-3-2-1 exercise](https://www.calm.com/blog/5-4-3-2-1-a-simple-exercise-to-calm-the-mind)
* [Gratitude journaling](https://www.rd.com/article/gratitude-journaling/)

# Movement

* My favourites: Yoga, Pilates, dancing, running, swimming, walking, SUPing
* [Your favourite kind of exercise here!]
* Use a fidget toy!

# Trick your body into making those sweet sweet happy chemicals

* Exercise!
* Dance in the kitchen.
* Sing! Loudly and (if you're like me) off-key.
* Cuddle. Owning cuddly toys as an adult is totally allowed.
* Make your home smell nice. Citrus scents and vanilla cheer you up, lavender and frankincense calm you down, or use a scent that reminds you of your happy place.
* Socialize. Humans are pack animals.
* Include done items on your to do list. Cross them off. Feel accomplished.
* Want to have birthday cake on a random Wednesday afternoon? Buy the cake. You're an adult, you make the rules.
* [Trap carbon dioxide in ephemeral spheres!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nathanwpyle/comments/ihl181/ephemeral_spheres)
* If you can't make your own serotonine, store bought is fine.

# The things nobody wants to hear

* Eat your veggies! Fuel your body with healthy food! (But indulging your sweet tooth now and then is totally fine!)
* Drink plenty of water.
* Sleep!
  * Practice [sleep hygiene](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene).
  * Try a weighted blanket.
  * [This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfcAVejslrU) can make you drowsy. (So don't listen while driving!)
* Stay away from/limit intake of caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, drugs of any kind.
* Get fresh air and sunlight.
  * Supplement vitamin D if necessary, but try to get as much air and daylight as you can. (But don't forget your SPF!)
  * Try a light therapy lamp.
* Exercise!
  * Regularly and in healthy doses.
  * Find something fun. Dancing is exercise, hiking is exercise, skating is exercise!
  * I personally feel best when I get enough outside exercise, even/especially in the winter.
* Take your medical checkups seriously. Your hormones, your thyroid and other physical factors can have a big effect on your psyche.
* Spring clean your online habits:
  * Stop doomscrolling.
  * Limit your screentime.
  * Limit your exposure to social media.
  * Unfollow _all_ accounts that make you feel bad.

# Everything that's worth doing is worth doing poorly.

* No energy to make a sandwich? Snack on a piece of bread, a slice of cheese, a few leaves of lettuce, maybe a tomato.
* Showering seems undoable? Been there. But can you maybe wash your face and brush your teeth? You will feel better for it. If you have energy left after that, use some dry shampoo or just wash your bangs (also a life hack for when you have overslept!)
* The flat is messy and you're overwhelmed? Put away three things today. The bed is a good place to start. You deserve a cozy bed. Yes, even when the dishes need doing. Or set a timer to do 10 minutes of cleaning.
* There are no rules. [Run the dishwasher twice.](https://kategrosvenor.com/blog/run-the-dishwasher-twice/)
* Feeling bad because you can't put in 100% at work at the moment? I know you, you're a perfectionist. Your 50% is still better than other people's 100%.
* Are you beating yourself up because you procrastinated on doing a task until the very last minute? Again? That's what deadlines are for! Handing in something on the last day is still on time. Didn't make the deadline? That's what extensions are for. Most deadlines have them.

# Perspective

* Sweating the small stuff again? Play the "What's the worst that can happen?" game. You have 27 million more chores to do and the supermarket is closing in 5 and you haven't shopped for groceries and the kids are going to be hungry and they're going to be cranky if you don't feed them asap but you have to finish this report before you can go to the shops and OMG OMG OMG how will you ever manage?! Worst case? You don't make it to the supermarket. What then? Order a pizza. Or have cereal for dinner.
* Considering to the vastness of the universe and the insignificance of human existence on a cosmic scale, how much does it really matter if you have that second piece of cake? Life is short. Eat the cake.
* Quick, without thinking, tell me what your colleague wore to work today? So do you really think anybody will have noticed that tiny coffee stain on your shirt?

# Get help!

* **Never forget. You are not alone. You don't need to do this alone.**
* Speak to a loved one.
* Speak to a professional.
* _If you can't make your own serotonine, store bought is fine._
* In a crisis, call a  crisis helpline ([Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines), [USA](https://findahelpline.com/))!

I hope you found something here that makes a hard day even a tiny little bit less hard. Remember you have a perfect track record of making it through your worst days. You can do it. I believe in you. You're not alone.

All my love,  
Sophie
